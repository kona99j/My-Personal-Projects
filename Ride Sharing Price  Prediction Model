Ride Sharing Price Prediction — Machine Learning Project

Cleaned and analyzed a large ride-sharing dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify price patterns, outliers, correlations, and peak demand periods.

Engineered features such as average speed (mph), encoded categorical variables (weather, vehicle type, locations), and scaled numerical features to improve model performance.

Built and compared multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Voting Regressor to predict ride prices.

Optimized model performance using feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R².

Achieved strong predictive performance using ensemble models, demonstrating improved accuracy over baseline models.

Visualized relationships between price, distance, duration, hour of day, weather, and location using Matplotlib/Seaborn to extract actionable insights.
